### Final Thoughts
I learned a lot from this project. I'm very inexperienced with Express apps let alone the depths of JS that this app requires, so I enjoyed the challenge. I'd love to eventually revisit this project in a few months to improve and simplify my code, as well as, expand on this further.

Thanks for taking a look!
